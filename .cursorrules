# 🔍 Project-Wide AI Rules - Isolation System (2025)

## 🎯 System Overview

This project uses the **Isolation-Focused Memory Bank System** with Custom Slash Commands for phased development workflow.

**Core Principle**: Memory Bank MUST be created and verified before any operations.

## 📋 Available Slash Commands

Use these commands in Cursor AI chat:

- `/van` - Initialize project with Memory Bank creation
- `/plan` - Task planning and WBS breakdown
- `/creative` - Design decisions and architecture planning
- `/implement` - Code implementation with progress tracking
- `/reflect` - Task review and retrospective
- `/archive` - Documentation and knowledge preservation

## 🚨 Critical Rules

### 1. Memory Bank System (MANDATORY)

**Before ANY operation, verify Memory Bank exists:**

```
memory-bank/
├── tasks.md           # Source of truth for all tasks
├── activeContext.md   # Current focus and active work
├── creative-*.md      # Design decisions (created in /creative)
└── progress.md        # Implementation status (updated in /implement)
```

**If Memory Bank doesn't exist:**
- STOP all operations immediately
- Run `/van` command to initialize
- Wait for verification before proceeding

### 2. Workflow Phases

**Strict phase sequence (recommended):**
```
/van → /plan → /creative → /implement → /reflect → /archive
```

**Each phase has prerequisites:**
- `/plan` requires: Memory Bank with tasks.md
- `/creative` requires: Planned tasks from /plan
- `/implement` requires: Design decisions from /creative
- `/reflect` requires: Implementation progress from /implement
- `/archive` requires: Completed reflection from /reflect

### 3. File State Verification

**Before executing commands, check required files:**

| Command | Reads | Creates/Updates |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| `/van` | - | tasks.md, activeContext.md |
| `/plan` | tasks.md, activeContext.md | tasks.md (updated) |
| `/creative` | tasks.md | creative-*.md, tasks.md |
| `/implement` | tasks.md, creative-*.md | progress.md, tasks.md |
| `/reflect` | tasks.md, progress.md | tasks.md (updated) |
| `/archive` | tasks.md, progress.md | archived docs |

### 4. Platform Awareness

**Detect and use platform-specific commands:**

**Linux/Mac (current environment):**
- Create file: `touch file.txt`
- Create directory: `mkdir -p directory`
- View content: `cat file.txt`
- List files: `ls -la`

**Windows:**
- Create file: `echo. > file.txt`
- Create directory: `mkdir directory`
- View content: `type file.txt`
- List files: `dir`

## 🎓 AI Behavior Guidelines

### When User Runs Slash Commands

1. **Always verify Memory Bank first**
   - Check if `memory-bank/` directory exists
   - Verify required files are present
   - If missing, guide user to run `/van`

2. **Read relevant context**
   - Load tasks.md for current task list
   - Load activeContext.md for current focus
   - Load relevant creative-*.md for design context
   - Load progress.md for implementation status

3. **Execute phase-specific responsibilities**
   - Follow the command definition in `.cursor/commands/[command].md`
   - Create/update required Memory Bank files
   - Provide clear next steps

4. **Document actions**
   - Update Memory Bank files with changes
   - Log decisions in appropriate files
   - Suggest next command in workflow

### Code Implementation Rules

1. **Read before write**
   - Always read existing code before modifying
   - Check current architecture and patterns
   - Maintain consistency with existing codebase

2. **Progress tracking**
   - Update progress.md during implementation
   - Mark tasks as complete in tasks.md
   - Document blockers and decisions

3. **Quality standards**
   - Follow project coding standards
   - Add appropriate tests
   - Update documentation

### Communication Style

1. **Be explicit about current phase**
   ```
   🚀 VAN MODE: Initializing Memory Bank...
   📋 PLAN MODE: Breaking down tasks...
   🎨 CREATIVE MODE: Documenting design decisions...
   💻 IMPLEMENT MODE: Implementing feature X...
   🔍 REFLECT MODE: Conducting retrospective...
   📚 ARCHIVE MODE: Finalizing documentation...
   ```

2. **Provide clear status**
   - What was done
   - What remains
   - Any blockers
   - Suggested next step

3. **Reference Memory Bank**
   - Cite tasks from tasks.md
   - Reference design decisions from creative-*.md
   - Show progress from progress.md

## 🔄 System Integration

**This .cursorrules file provides:**
1. ✅ Automatic rule loading for all AI conversations
2. ✅ Memory Bank system awareness
3. ✅ Phase-based workflow enforcement
4. ✅ Platform-specific command guidance
5. ✅ Consistent AI behavior across sessions

**How it works:**
- Cursor AI automatically loads this file
- Rules apply to all conversations in this project
- Slash commands (`/van`, `/plan`, etc.) extend these rules
- Memory Bank files provide persistent context

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Skip Memory Bank verification
- ❌ Modify Memory Bank files outside workflow
- ❌ Jump phases without completing prerequisites
- ❌ Ignore file state requirements

**ALWAYS:**
- ✅ Verify Memory Bank before operations
- ✅ Update Memory Bank after changes
- ✅ Follow phase sequence
- ✅ Document decisions and progress

## 🚀 Getting Started

**New to this project? Start here:**

1. Run system verification:
   ```bash
   ./.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/verify_setup.sh
   ```

2. Initialize Memory Bank:
   ```
   Type in Cursor AI: /van
   ```

3. Read Quick Start:
   ```bash
   cat .cursor/rules/isolation_rules/QUICK_START_2025.md
   ```

4. Follow the workflow:
